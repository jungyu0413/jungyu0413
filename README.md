# üëã Hi, I'm Jun Gyu Lee

**MS Student @ KIST School (UST)**  
BS in Big Data Analytics, Kookmin University  

I'm currently researching **Facial Expression Recognition**, **Face Recognition**, and real-time applications of human-centered AI.  
My work focuses on making AI models more robust, interpretable, and practical in the wild.
