# 👋 Hi, I'm Jun Gyu Lee

**MS Student @ KIST School (UST)**  
BS in Big Data Analytics, Kookmin University  

I'm currently researching **Facial Expression Recognition**, **Face Recognition**, and real-time applications of human-centered AI.  
My work focuses on making AI models more robust, interpretable, and practical in the wild.

## 🖥️ Realtime Applications

### [Realtime Expression Recognition (Expression Classification)](https://github.com/jungyu0413/realtime_emotion)
Real-time facial expression recognition using softmax-based classification.  
Includes face detection, preprocessing, and visualization.

### [Realtime Expression Recognition (Valence-Arousal Estimation)](https://github.com/jungyu0413/realtime_emotion)
Extension of expression recognition to continuous affect modeling via valence–arousal space.  
Includes real-time video interface and visual affect mapping.

### [Realtime Face Detector](https://github.com/jungyu0413/realtime_face_detector)
Lightweight face detector for real-time webcam input.  
Based on SSD and RetinaFace; tuned for single-person detection scenarios.
