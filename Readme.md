# üëã Hi, I'm JunGyu Lee

**MS Student @ KIST School (UST)**  
BS in BigData Analytics, Kookmin University  

I'm currently researching **Facial Expression Recognition**, **Face Recognition**, and real-time applications of human-centered AI.  
My work focuses on making AI models more **robust**, **interpretable**, and **practical** in real-world environments.

I'm particularly interested in developing AI systems that **understand humans most effectively** ‚Äî both emotionally and behaviorally.  
Ultimately, I aspire to become a researcher who contributes to society and the nation through **AI technologies that truly serve people**.
